You can hardly swing a bunch of kale *without* hitting a vegan product that is certified organic[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_certification "An overview of the organic certification process is available on Wikipedia") these days. Why is this, I wonder? I mean, we should all know by now that organic farming is just like regular agriculture except it uses what is "natural" as its measure. What is naturally derived, without humans, isn’t a guarantee of safeness<!--more--> or 'goodness'[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature "An appeal to nature is an argument or rhetorical tactic in which it is proposed that a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is 'unnatural'"). Organic agriculture uses pesticides[*](http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/06/18/137249264/organic-pesticides-not-an-oxymoron "Certain pesticides are allowed in certified organic farming, as outlined in this NPR article"), isn’t healthier[*](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/09/little-evidence-of-health-benefits-from-organic-foods-study-finds.html "A study conducted by Dena Bravata and published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found 'There isn’t much difference between organic and conventional foods, if you’re an adult and making a decision based solely on your health'"), and isn’t better for the environment[*](http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2012/120904.html "Oxford university scientists completed a meta analysis that suggests organic farming does not have a lower environmental impact than conventional farming") than modern agriculture. So what does this have to do with veganism?

Vegans are typically astute ethical consumers who carefully weigh the consequences of their purchases. They are careful to reduce the chances of participating in any form of animal exploitation mostly by avoiding certain products. There are products made from animal bodies themselves, like flesh. Products that are made by animal bodies, like milk. And animal-derived products that, while not ingredients of a final product, are used in processing (for example, bone char filtration in the sugar-making process). [As I’ve written in the past](http://pythagoreancrank.com/?p=1667 "My article ‘NOT VEGAN’ discusses this in more detail"), this can go on to an absurd degree, but I’d concede that, in general, vegans focus is on the most obvious animals products. By paying such close attention to these details, many vegans feel that they are ‘voting with their dollars.’

Then there are organic products with their health halo[*](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110410130831.htm "Some organic foods are surrounded by a ‘health halo’ despite no supporting scientific evidence. This article in Science Daily examines the psychological reasons why"), which might lend a glow to vegans’ ethical calculations in their consumer decisions. Many vegans seem unaware how this label tramples upon their cause. Let’s look at some of the issues:

##Cost

Vegans love to advocate their cause because it means fewer animals are being slaughtered with each new adherent. Lowering the barriers to entry is something many vegans would support. But, since organic food limits itself to a relative standard of natural purity, there are added costs in producing organic food. Modern biotech agricultural solutions can help reduce expensive inputs and labor for farmers, thereby reducing cost to consumers. Inexpensive, tasty vegan food options are a win for the cause. If there were a vegan product that tasted just as good and cheaper than the animal version, what consumer wouldn’t opt for the vegan version? Because organic foods are more expensive[*](http://www.fao.org/organicag/oa-faq/oa-faq5/en/ "This FAQ page on the Food and Agrigculture Organisation of the United States explains why organic food is more expensive"), this makes veganism that much less possible and practical[*](http://www.vegansociety.com/about/who-we-are.aspx "'possible and practical' qualifiers of veganism as defined by the Vegan Society") for no good reason at all.

##Animal Care

While vegans avoid animal products altogether, they also care about welfare issues and wish to reduce animals' suffering[*](http://arzone.ning.com/profiles/blogs/a-meaningful-life-matt-ball "This blog article for the Animal Rights Zone eloquently describes the vegan position"). On organic farms though, antibiotics that provide relief for sick animals[*](http://inthesetimes.com/article/6330/the_cruel_irony_of_organic_standards "This article exposes the consequences of withholding medical interventions for animals on organic farms") and vaccines made with genetic engineering[*](http://www.capitalpress.com/Organic/20141014/organic-industry-confused-by-gmo-vaccines "Many vaccines usually given to farm animals contain GMO ingredients and are therefore withheld from animals on organic farms") to protect them from disease are not allowed. Instead, health practices for animals in their care rely in part upon quack homeopathic remedies[*](http://www.mofga.org/Portals/2/Fact%20Sheets/FS%20Raising%20Organic%20Livestock.pdf "Maine Organic Farmers and Gardener’s association suggest homeopathic remedies as acceptable treatment for abrasions under organic standards"). It’s one thing to make a personal choice to employ such remedies upon yourself, but to impose that upon another creature without regard to proven scientific efficacy is a despicable practice no vegan should stand behind. Withholding modern medical treatments from animals within organic farmers care is worse than the unnatural bogeyman. It’s cruel and unjust; it’s not vegan.

##Nitrogen

Plants require nitrogen. Specifically, plants that are farmed for people to eat require nitrogen-containing fertilizer. Even though our atmosphere[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process "The 'Haber Process' an overview on Wikipedia here") contains a whole lotta nitrogen, plants can’t use it unless it’s “fixed” into a form that is available to them biologically. Agriculture struggled with finding abundant sources of nitrogen until we figured out a way to harvest that from the atmosphere. But this synthetic fertilizer is not natural enough for organic, so it is forbidden. Much organic-allowed fertilizer is in the form of animal parts[*](http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/archives/parsons/earthkind/ekgarden8.html "A list of common organic fertilizers from Texas Agrilife Extension Service") such as fish, blood and bone meal, and cow manure. The manure is interesting because the only reason it has nitrogen in the first place is because it’s in the non-organic feed[*](http://www.inexactchange.org/blog/2013/03/28/unlikely-fix/ "The topic is explored in more detail in an excellent article by Adam Merberg of Inexact Change"). Somehow nitrogen becomes more natural once it’s passed through the bodies of animals[*](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/no-cows-dont-make-fertilizer.html "'Cows don’t produce nitrogen, they just launder it'") so they’re cheating on their own standards[*](http://csanr.wsu.edu/organic-ag-synthetic-nitrogen/ "As Andrew McGuire explains in this article for the Centre for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources"). Is your head spinning yet?

If animal-derived products used in processing like bone char with sugar or isinglass with beer is a vegan issue then maybe Veganic[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegan_organic_gardening "Vegan organic gardening and farming is the organic cultivation and production of food crops and other crops with a minimal amount of exploitation or harm to any animal") is the only option. But that I think is the wrong direction and misses the point of veganism. Shouldn’t we be encouraging the use of non-animal-derived inputs while maximizing the outputs? To do that we should implement every tool at our disposal but that’s not the way organic rolls. Manure-based fertilizer is animal-derived, not vegan.

##GMO

Genetically modifying organisms has already proved useful in medicine by replacing animal-derived insulin for diabetics with a synthetic one made with genetically modified bacteria[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humulin "Humulin (biosynthetic human insulin products) entry on Wikipedia"). Vaccines made through GM plants[*](http://news.discovery.com/earth/weather-extreme-events/flu-vaccine-tobacco-120925.htm "A Canadian bio-pharma company are developing a flu vaccine derived from tobacco, as discussed in this article from Discovery News") or insect cells[*](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/flublok-a-flu-vaccine-wins-fda-approval.html?_r=0 "A flu vaccine based on insect cells won FDA approval in 2013, the New York Times reports") instead of chicken eggs is another example of how this technology can help reduce reliance on animal products.

In matters of agriculture though, this technology can provide unique sources for nutrients that vegans may lack. An example like omega-3 biofortified grain[*](http://www.biofortified.org/2011/04/australian-scientific-collaboration-set-to-break-world%E2%80%99s-reliance-on-fish-for-long-chain-omega-3/ "Biology Fortified reports on the race to develop omega 3 fortified grain") can both make it easier to get that nutrient from food without supplementation and also offset sourcing from fish. Many farmers use broad-spectrum insecticides, which kill indiscriminately, regardless of whether or not a bug is harmful to the crops. Plants that are genetically modified to produce their own narrow-spectrum pesticide, like Bt corn[*](http://www.vegangmo.com/?p=132 "Corn genetically engineered to contain Bt toxin reduces the number of insect deaths when compared to broad-spectrum pesticides"), kill fewer insects by targeting only those that pose a threat. Or what about avoiding killing insects altogether by creating a plant that can emit an odorless pheromone that scares away pests[*](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/28/us-wheat-gmo-britain-idUSBRE82R0ZR20120328 "Reuters report that trials are in progress for a GMO wheat that should 'scare away' aphids")? We’re just scratching the surface as to what this technology can bring, and vegans would do well to embrace genetic modification. Genetically modifying crops to produce nutrients that are commonly derived from animals, or to reduce our reliance on pesticides, will reduce needless animal deaths.

Genetic modification is a safe[*](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/08/27/glp-infographic-international-science-organizations-on-crop-biotechnology-safety/ "An overview of international science organisation’s conclusions on GMO crop safety"), precise form of plant breeding, yet is deemed unacceptable by organic standards. Scrambling plants' DNA to force random mutations with radiation or chemicals[*](http://www.science20.com/kevin_folta/atomic_gardening_ultimate_frankenfoods-91836 "Atomic Gardening is acceptable under organic standards and has been used for decades, Kevin M. Folta explains for Science2.0") is just fine by them though. Are you noticing a pattern here? Supporting organic is a missed opportunity to leverage technology to grow the vegan movement.

##Nutrition Supplements

While the research on DHA is still coming in RDs are recommending DHA supplementation[*](http://veganhealth.org/articles/omega3 "Jack Norris RD details the recommended supplements of omega 3’s and DHA for vegans") for vegans to err on the safe side. Usually this nutrient is acquired from the flesh of fish but science has figured out a way to bypass the middle-fish[*](http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2012/algae-dha-healthy-as-fish-oil/ "A review of the research suggests Algae derived DHA is as effective as DHA derived from fish") and go straight to the sources: algae. It’s too bad that this isn’t natural enough for Organic[*](http://www.cornucopia.org/USDA/OrganicWatergateWhitePaper.pdf "The Cornucopia Institute published this document that strongly denounce algae derived DHA and rejects any suggestion that it can be deemed ‘organic’"). They recommend getting it from fish instead. Fishes are animals last time I checked. Not vegan.

##Environment

The inefficiencies of eschewing modern technology means organic farming falls more and more behind modern agriculture in terms of yields[*](http://www.nature.com/news/organic-farming-is-rarely-enough-1.10519 "The journal Nature published an article detailing how conventional farming tecniques produce higher yields than organic"). Getting less product from the land requires taking more land away from local wildlife to match the yields of modern farming. Doing more with less is a driving factor for agriculture and who doesn’t want that? Using genetic modification we could engineer plants to even be more efficient with nitrogen[*](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2013/03/18/nitrogen-efficient-crops-the-holy-grail-of-agricultural-biotech/ "Kenrick Vezina's ‘Nitrogen Efficient Crops: the Holy Grail of Agricultural Biotech?’ for The Genetic Literacy Project"). Fungicides, composting, tillage are other practices[*](http://appliedmythology.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/six-reasons-organic-is-not-most.html "This article on Applied Mythology lists six reasons why organic farming is not the most environmentally friendly way to farm, including less than optimal fungicides, high carbon footprint composting and necessity for soil tilling") that aren't quite environmentally ideal. Striving to leave a small footprint as well as affect fauna as little as possible should be a concern for all vegans.

##Veganism Trumps Organicism

Vegans may mean well when they buy organic products, but this dubious designation should be better scrutinized to discover how it undermines and cashes in on the vegan cause. What’s needed are rational decisions and sound scientific policy, not mythical[*](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/2011/07/18/mythbusting-101-organic-farming-conventional-agriculture/ "This Scientific American article calls the idea that organic farming is better than conventional farming a myth... then busts it") "natural" appeals of faith-based agriculture such as organic. There is nothing organic can do that modern agriculture can’t yet there is a whole lot organic limits itself from. The “conventional” vs organic divide is a false dichotomy[*](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/the-organic-false-dichotomy/ "Steven Novella’s assessment of ‘The Organic False Dichotomy’") and causes unnecessary confusion, harm, and stunts progress for the movement. If veganism is a credible and noble way to live why is there this organic label slapped on most of the vegan products? Why are vegans being unfairly burdened with this tax? How is that helping the animals for which the cause is supposedly focused upon? Vegans are being suckered and their pockets being picked by BigOrganic Agribusiness. Ditch those archaic organic products already and support safe, innovative, and accessible food products for all[*](http://www.biofortified.org/2010/08/toward-a-better-agriculture/ "Biology Fortified present many of the current advantages of GMO crops and speculate on future developments").

The point I’m trying to make here though isn’t so much that organic itself is any less or more vegan really, but that the dogma must stop. [Ditch the baloney!](http://pythagoreancrank.com/?p=1783 "Details of the ‘Baloney isn’t Vegan’ leaflet’s incarnation") It’s time vegans use their heads along with their hearts and make smart, reasoned choices for the considerations of their earthling cousins. If exploiting animals is natural enough for organic standards then maybe vegans should reconsider their bedfellows.
