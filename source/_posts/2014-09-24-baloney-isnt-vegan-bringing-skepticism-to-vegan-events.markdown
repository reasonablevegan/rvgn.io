You've probably seen the [Baloney Isn't Vegan](http://www.meetup.com/vegan-chicago/pages/Baloney_Detection/) flyer produced by [Vegan Chicago](http://www.meetup.com/vegan-chicago/). Inspired by Michael Shermer's Baloney Detection Kit[*](http://www.michaelshermer.com/2009/06/baloney-detection-kit/ "The Baloney Detection Kit (on RDF TV), presented by The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science"), developed over a period of months[*](http://www.plantbasedpeople.com/showthread.php?t=17600 "A thread on PlantBasedPeople.com dedicated to developing the flyer, circa 2011") and professionally designed, the intention of the project is to promote the fundamental skills of critical thinking to a vegan audience. In the words<!--more--> of its creator, Dave D of [PythagoreanCrank](http://pythagoreancrank.com):

>I could just be yet another crank who thinks he’s thinking critically but really conforming it around a cherished bias. But how can one go wrong with advocating critical thinking? This, I think, is my new platform. I feel compelled to leverage my years of vegan advocacy experience to adopt this cause in the same manner. It’s a cause that is so fundamental that every other justice issue could benefit. It’s not just a solution, it’s a toolkit to empower the thinker to discover and invent their own solutions. As far as I know there hasn’t been a leaflet made up and passed out on the matter. That is my challenge.[*](http://pythagoreancrank.com/?p=1783 "Vegan Baloney – PythagoreanCrank.com, November 20th, 2011")

Since then, the flyers have been in evidence at all sorts of vegan gatherings, and even some skeptical events like The Amazing Meeting. Vegan Chicago have essentially put the design for the flyer in the public domain (and produced a a listing on the print-on-demand site Zazzle for easy acquisiton[*](http://www.zazzle.com/baloney_detection_guide_flyer-244387278526919188 "Baloney Detection Guide Flyer on Zazzle.com")). As a result, the flyers have an impressive distribution: I've encountered them on the far side of the Atlantic – even though the word *baloney* is not common in British English.
