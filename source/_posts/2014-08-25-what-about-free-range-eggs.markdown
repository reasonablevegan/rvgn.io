One of the questions I’m sure all vegans face regularly is *but… what about free range eggs?*' without even addressing the more controversial and complicated arguments about animals as property and the implications of that paradigm. It’s easy to explain that even free-range eggs are not cruelty and death free.<!--more-->

Male chickens do not lay eggs, but chickens are born roughly 50/50 male and female. Therefore the male ‘layer’ chickens are of no use to the egg industry. Male chicks are disposed of in horrific ways shortly after hatching[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling "details of the methods used for chick culling are available on Wikipedia ").

For every hen who grows up to be farmed for her eggs whether in a battery cage or a ‘free range’ facility there is a male chick who was thrown into a grinder.

When reading articles discussing the cross over between feminist theory and veganism it occurred to me that if these chicks had a voice, a copy of The Sexual Politics of Meat[*](http://www.caroljadams.com/spom.html "Carol J Adams’  The Sexual Politics of Meat is one of the most insightful books on this intersection and well worth a read") and the cognitive abilities required they might cheep out in a tiny voice *what patriarchy?*
