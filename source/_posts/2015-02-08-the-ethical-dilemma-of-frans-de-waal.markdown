The other day I was in a discussion panel after a talk by world renowned primatologist Frans De Waal[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal "Frans De Waal is is a Dutch primatologist and ethologist. Author of many popular books exploring primate social behaviour and how it relates to us human primates. For an overview of his life and work check out his Wikipedia page") in Brussels. I have great respect for De Waal and his work. He has a positive view on humanity, and refuses to be overly afraid of anthropomorphizing when analyzing animal behavior. Moreover, he actively promotes his<!--more--> views among the masses in very popular books[*](http://www.amazon.com/Frans-De-Waal/e/B000APOHE0 "Frans De Waal’s bibiography is available on Amazon"), rather than confining himself to the walls of his university or primate research center.

In preparing my contribution to the panel, I quickly checked if I could find anything related to his views on eating meat and vegetarianism. This is the only thing I found, on the online magazine Wonderlancer:

>**WONDERLANCER:** What are your views on eating animal meat? Is that natural in us and thus necessary and unavoidable, like in many other carnivorous species? How do we reconcile our carnivorous ways with the notion of animal conscience and emotion?

>**FRANS DE WAAL:** Eating meat is as natural for our close relatives, the chimpanzees, as it is for us. In fact, hunting large game and sharing the pay-offs has probably played a major role in human evolution, resulting in reciprocity and cooperation at a level few other animals achieve. The mammals that do achieve high levels of cooperation are mostly carnivores, such as killer whales and wolves, and also chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys cooperate during hunts. So, meat has been very important to our lineage. Whether we need to eat meat is a separate question for me, since I think we are smart enough to find ways of obtaining the nutrients we need without meat. It doesn’t seem a strict necessity. I myself do like and eat meat, but the practices of the agricultural meat industry bother me for ethical reasons, and I would be very happy if we either could change those practices or raise meat in the absence of a central nervous system. What I mean is meat-growing plants where muscles are grown without growing the entire animal, so that suffering can be excluded. This possibility seems to be getting closer, and would remove the ethical dilemma for me.[*](http://wonderlancer.com/socialogue/frans-de-waal-the-age-of-empathy/ "An interview with De Waal on the online magazine Wonderlancer")

I'm happy of course that De Waal finds meat eating at least problematic, but I have two issues with his answer. First of all, if he uses the evolutionary role of eating meat (which as far as I know is not a proven fact but rather a theory, and a contested one at that) as a justification to keep doing it. This smacks of an appeal to nature[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature "From Wikipedia: An appeal to nature is an argument or rhetorical tactic in which it is proposed that a thing is good because it is 'natural', or bad because it is 'unnatural'"). I’m sure De Waal is familiar with appeals to nature, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he means something else, or maybe his words were changed a bit. Or maybe I'm just interpreting it incorrectly.

The second issue I have is with the term "ethical dilemma", which is used twice in the excerpt. I can empathize with the fact that De Waal, caring about what happens to animals while at the same time liking the taste of meat, experiences this as a dilemma. However, I think it's not right to call it an *ethical dilemma*. This is how Wikipedia defines ethical dilemma: 

>a complex situation that often involves an apparent mental conflict between moral imperatives, in which to obey one would result in transgressing another.[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_dilemma "Drawn from Wikipedia’s ‘ethical dilemma’ page")

In the case of eating meat or not, there is no conflict between different moral (ethical) imperatives. There is only a conflict between taste (some people might erroneously also think health[*](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx "The the UK NHS advice page on vegan diets assures its readers that: ‘With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs’ and goes on to make sensible dietary recommendations")[*](http://www.eatright.org/About/Content.aspx?id=8357 "American and Canadian dietitians concur: The American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada published a joint position paper in 2003 on vegan diets, in which they wrote that properly planned vegan diets were nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including pregnancy and lactation. Here is a link to their position paper on vegetarian diets")) on the one hand, and the suffering and death of animals on the other. The fact many people would call this an ethical dilemma (or even merely a dilemma) at all, shows a lot about the value or weight we give to farm animals' concerns.
