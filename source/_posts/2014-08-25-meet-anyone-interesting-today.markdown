When writing the article [why are vegans so self righteous?](/ "FIXME!") I was particularly interested in the way  we confirm and perpetuate stereotypes. One of the mechanisms the human mind has for this is confirmation bias[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Wikipedia article on confirmation bias") –
 people remember occurrences that confirm their preconceived stereotypes, such as ‘the self-righteous vegan’. <!--more-->
 
Another, more simple way in which self-righteous vegans represent all vegans in the minds of non-vegans is that interesting dramatic people stand out more in our memory.

This cartoon is intended to illustrate the way our memories prioritise the loud self-righteous vegan who holds our attention and confirms our preconceptions over all the other less demonstrative vegans.

Also I want that T-Shirt.
