*Angry Scientist Finds Uneducated Internet Comment and Delivers Badass Response*[*](http://themetapicture.com/angry-scientist-finds-uneducated-internet-comment-and-delivers-badass-response "Here is the tumblr post that inspired my interest, anger and - after some consideration - this article"). With a title like this how could I resist clicking on the link that a friend sent me recently? The aforementioned Internet comment was in fact a Tumblr post that implied that vaccinating children is ‘child endangerment and abuse’ and encouraged the reader to<!--more--> ‘rethink vaccines’. Reading this familiar anti-vax rhetoric I was already looking forward to the ‘badass’ scientist’s comeback, but within the first few lines of their response I was disappointed and angry. It read:

>You are the worst person.

So far so good, I thought. I understand resorting to hyperbole when it comes to defending children's health and science.

>You can be a vegan and whine at people, that’s hurting nobody but when you tell people to stop taking vaccines you endanger public health...

What followed was a list of the ingredients in vaccines with a brief explanation of what they do, why they are not a harmful and a plea for people to act responsibly and trust science over the fear-mongering tactics of anti-vaxxers. The scientist’s response is admittedly ‘rage filled and alcohol induced’, which is probably why it is so entertaining and vehement, but I couldn’t excuse the two references to veganism which seemed completely superfluous since the anti-vax post did not reference veganism at all. 

>Why don’t YOU educate yourself instead of subscribing to the notion that all scientists are evil and want to poison you and your natural, vegan lifestyle.

Why drag us vegans into this? I felt offended that the scientist equated vegans with anti-vaxxers and was publicly tarnishing our movement… Then I took a step back, and a breath, and I realised that this scientist’s perception of vegans is illustrative of a much larger problem, and though it may seem unreasonable to me it is in fact completely understandable.

Anti-vax sentiment does seem to be rife within the vegan community. I have been handed leaflets warning me of the ‘dangers of vaccines’ at vegan events and I have friends with children who have been harassed by fellow vegans for vaccinating their children. One father was accused of abusing his child when he mentioned on a vegan forum that his daughter was vaccinated. It is unsurprising that a drunk immunologist would link vegans and anti-vaxxers. Rather than get offended with someone for recognising a correlation perhaps a more appropriate response would be to combat anti-vax pseudo-science within my community.

So here goes.

###What are vaccines?

A vaccine is a biological preparation usually administered by intramuscular injection. It typically  contains an *inactive* form of pathogen which stimulates the immune system into producing antibodies to fight the pathogen. A vaccination immunises the person against the targeted disease by preparing their immune system to recognise and destroy *active *pathogens[*](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf "This is a very simplified description of how vaccinations work for more detail from a more scientifically knowledgeable source please consult this factsheet produced by the CDC"). Vaccinations have been incredibly successful in combating disease. One of the most dramatic victories has been the eradication of smallpox, a horrific infectious disease which in its more aggressive strain killed 30-35 percent of those infected. A vaccination was developed for smallpox in 1796 and on the 8th of May 1980 the World Health Organisation certified the global eradication of smallpox in this landmark announcement:

>The world and its peoples have won freedom from smallpox, which was a most devastating disease sweeping in epidemic form through many countries since earliest time, leaving death, blindness and disfigurement in its wake and which only a decade ago was rampant in Africa, Asia and South America[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Eradication "From the wikipedia article on the eradication of Smallpox").

The polio vaccine is another success story which has reduced poliomyelitis from a worldwide epidemic to a disease only thought to be endemic to three countries[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis "From the wikipedia article on Polio"). Vaccinations are currently in use combatting many diseases and work is underway to develop vaccinations for more infectious diseases.

###The vegan-ness of vaccines

Vaccines, like many medicines, often contain animal derived ingredients. These are inactive ingredients (excipients) used to preserve or stabilise the vaccine. The manufacturing of vaccines also uses animal products all of which are listed as excipients on vaccination information leaflets. Gelatine is used as a stabiliser in some vaccines. Some viruses used in vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, are grown in fertilised hens eggs while some are grown on animal cell lines[*](http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients "For a thorough list of all common vaccine ingredients please refer to the Vaccine Knowledge Project from the University of Oxford"). Because they contain animal products most vaccines cannot be described as vegan. But can someone who gets themselves or their children vaccinated describe themselves as vegan? My response would be a resolute yes. The Vegan Society's definition of the word vegan is as follows:

>Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose[*](https://www.vegansociety.com/try-vegan/definition-veganism "The Vegan Society's definition of ‘Vegan’")

Since vegan versions of many vaccines are not currently available it is not possible or practical to avoid the animal products in vaccinations, a vegan who gets themselves and their family vaccinated is no less vegan than one who uses transport with rubber tyres[*](http://thriftyveganliving.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/vegan-car-tyres.html "Unfortunately vulcanised rubber tyres often contain stearic acid derived from animal fat. If you buy your own tyres for a vehicle you may wish to seek out one of the few brands that don't use animal products in their manufacture"). I would recommend every vegan gets the vaccinations that their doctors advise for themselves and their children. This is one of the many unhappy things about living in a non-vegan world, we have to accept that we cannot entirely extricate ourselves from animal exploitation. 

If you are concerned about the suffering of the animals involved in the production of vaccines a sensible solution to ease your conscience and reduce animal suffering as a whole would be to make a donation to a vegan outreach charity, if your contribution can help make one more person vegan then you will have contributed to a net reduction in animal suffering. Harish Sethu of Counting Animals estimates a vegetarian spares the lives of between 371 and 582 animals in a year[*](http://www.countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/ "‘How Many Animals Does a Vegetarian Save?’ – Harish’s incredibly thorough analysis of the data is presented here") vegans save even more lives[*](http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/ "Estimates vary wildly on this number and I have been unable to find a analysis as detailed as Harish’s for the answer to ‘How Many Animals Does a Vegan Save.’ I think it's fair to say more than a vegetarian, but exactly how many more lives and how much suffering is a difficult question. A good place to start reading on this topic this is Brian Tomasik’s summary of his research into ‘How Much Direct Suffering is Caused By Animal Foods’"). Between one and five doses of the flu vaccine are derived from one fertilised chicken egg[*](http://skepticalvegan.com/2010/12/07/vaccines-vegans-autistic-puppies/ "According to this article over at Skeptical Vegan"). If every vegan who gets vaccinated donated to an effective vegan advocacy charity the number of animals exploited in vaccine production would pale into insignificance compared to those saved from the exploitation of animal agriculture. 

There is research currently underway into developing more efficient methods of vaccine production which may lead to vaccines with fewer or no animal ingredients. The use of fertilised chicken eggs is particularly slow and inefficient so hopefully will be phased out in favour of other techniques such as using cells in bioreactors[*](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091209193506.htm "‘Fast Method for Producing Vaccines Use Bioreactors Instead of Chicken Eggs’ from Science Daily") or by using virus like particles which are already used in the production of the vaccination for HPV[*](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/better-flu-vaccine/ "This Scientific American article discusses the use of VLP’s as an alternative to eggs in the production of vaccinations"). If you are interested in encouraging the development of medicine and medical research that does not exploit animals you can support the efforts of charities like The Dr Hadwen Trust[*](http://www.drhadwentrust.org/ "The Dr Hadwen Trust is the UK’s leading non-animal medical research charity") who fund new research that advances biomedical science without the use of animals.

###Why people think vaccines are dangerous

The majority of people who are opposed to vaccinations are not concerned about the animal products present in vaccines. They, like the creator of the original Tumblr post that inspired this article, are convinced that vaccines are dangerous to human health. They look at the list of excipients in vaccines and are concerned that some or all them are poisonous. The ingredients that seem to be of most concern to anti-vaxxers are Thimerosal (mercury), Aluminium based adjuvant, Polyethylene Glycol[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol "Often mistaken or misrepresented as Ethylene Glycol by anti-vax proponents and referred to completely erroneously as ‘anti-freeze’ (Ethylene Glycol is an ingredient in some brands of anti-freeze)") Piso Octylphenyl Ether[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_X-100 "Often mistaken or misrepresented as ‘Ether’ by anti-vax proponents Piso octylphenyl ether or Triton X-100 is a commonly used detergent in laboratories") Formaldehyde and Hydrochloric Acid. These ingredients do sound strange and unpleasant but they're all found in vaccines in tiny amounts, so tiny that most people are exposed to more of all these chemicals everyday by using things such as toothpaste[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol#Commercial_uses "Polyetheline Glycol is a common ingredient in toothpaste"), personal lubricants[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_glycol#Commercial_uses "Polyethylene Glycol is a common ingredient in personal lubricants"), baking powder[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking_powder "Aluminium is found in baking powder") and deodorant[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodorant "Aluminium is a common ingredient in deodorant")[*](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/toxic-myths-about-vaccines/ "In this article for Science Based Medicine Dr David Gorski thoroughly explains the excipient ingredients in vaccines and stresses that though some may be dangerous in large quantities in the quantities found in vaccines they are harmless"). And while they may seem foreign and unusual these ingredients are not dangerous; in fact formaldehyde (one of the most scary sounding, at least to me) is part of a humans normal metabolism[*](http://www.harpocratesspeaks.com/2012/04/demystifying-vaccine-ingredients.html "This article gives a good explanaton of what formaldehyde is and it’s role in human metabolism"). Many of these ingredients would be dangerous in larger quantities, but at the levels in vaccinations they are harmless and are used to make the vaccines more effective[*](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/vaccine-ingredients.aspx "For detailed reassurance about the ingredients in vaccines I suggest you consult the National Health Service site for an overview ")[*](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/6/1394.full "For a more technical examination of the ingredients in vaccines I suggest reffering to this comprehensive article published in the Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics ‘Addressing Parents' Concerns’").

The incorrect idea that the ingredients in vaccines (particularly Thimerosal)[*](http://antiantivax.flurf.net/#Thimerosal "Which is ironic since the majority of modern vaccines do not cointain Thimerosal and since the removal of this ingredient diagnosed cases of autism have risen not decreased") cause autism is still unfortunately quite prevalent. This misconception stems from the now discredited work of former surgeon and medical researcher Andrew Wakefield[*](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8700611.stm "His license to practice medicine has since been revoked"). Wakefield’s fraudulent paper that suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was published in the Lancet in 1998 it has since been retracted. No further studies were able to reproduce Wakefields results and upon investigation Wakefield was found to have subjected the children in his studies to unnecessary invasive medical procedures[*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC381348/ "This article details the cornerns over the unethical practices of Wakefield’s study including unessesary aupper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ileocolonoscopy, and lumbar punctures performed on vulnerable autistic children"), falsified data[*](http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full?tab=response-form "Evidence of the falsification of Wakefield’s data is published in this BMJ article") and intended to profit financially from his patent on an alternative ‘single jab’ vaccine[*](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/01/12/andrew-wakefield-in-it-for-the-money-all/ "Details of how Wakefield intended to profit from his claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism are sumarised in this article from Science Blogs"). The General Medical Council found Wakefield guilty of thirty six charges including four counts of dishonesty and twelve counts of the abuse of developmentally challenged children[*](http://briandeer.com/solved/gmc-charge-sheet.pdf "Andrew Wakfield’s ‘Fitness to Practice’ panel hearing"). Despite the link between autism and the MMR being thoroughly discredited and Wakefield’s exposure as a fraud some people still spread the idea that vaccines cause autism. Preying on the fact that autism is still a relatively little understood condition, the public's scientific illiteracy and the fears of worried parents anti-vaxxers such as Jenny McCarthy spread this dangerous fiction[*](http://www.jennymccarthybodycount.com "Consulting the site jennymccarthybodycount.com today I found an estimated 146,623 preventable illnesses and 8973 preventable deaths in the United States since the Anti-Vaccination movement gained traction in 2007").

The other common concern of those opposed to vaccinations is that vaccines provide too many pathogens for the immune system to cope with or too many too soon. This like the concern about the excipient ingredients is founded on a lack of contextual understanding of the human body. Our immune systems respond to a huge quantity of pathogens everyday as we encounter various viruses environmentally, it really is an amazing and vast protective system[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system "The immune system entry on Wikipedia"). Compared to the amount of work our immune system does on an average day the amount of pathogens we encounter in a vaccine is a drop in a ocean of germs[*](http://edgydoc.com/references/ "In episode 30 of the ‘Quackcast’ podcast Dr Mark Crislip compares the amount of antigens the immune system is exposed to by vaccines to the amount the immune system is exposed to by everyday environmental exposure: “Due to exposure to germs and other foreign material we make an order of one million to one hundred million different antibodies during our lives. At a minimum then you must produce one hundred and fifty new antibodies a day. The vaccination schedule, in total, would lead to the production of about thirty antibodies.” The Quackcast archive can be found here").

There is no reasonable mechanism proposed for vaccines being ‘dangerous’ or ‘poisonous’ and no evidence that they are not safe and effective preventative medicines. Like all medicines side effects and occasional serious allergic reactions do occur[*](http://www.immunizeforgood.com/resource-center/side-effects-from-vaccines "Side effects from vaccines") but they are massively outweighed by the number of lives saved by preventing diseases that disproportionately affect children and vulnerable adults. By vaccinating your children you take a tiny risk of adverse side effects to prevent a risk of life threatening disease not only for your child but for immunocompromised people that they may come into contact with. 

Vaccines are a well understood and evidence based intervention that have and continue to save millions of lives. The chart below[*](http://www.immunizeforgood.com/fact-or-fiction/benefits-vs.-risks "Chart from from Immunise for Good") documents the impact of vaccines in the United States.

Diseases like Polio[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis "Polio affected 416 people in 2013 mainly in Afganistan, Nigeria and Pakistan according to the Wikipedia article on Polio") and Diphtheria[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphtheria "Responsible for 3,300 deaths in 2013 mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and Indonesia according to the wikipedia article on Diphtheria") have been entirely eradicated from western countries but people in the third world still suffer and die from these diseases. Perhaps it is easy to become complacent about our health when we have access to modern medicine and we may be convinced by dubious arguments that vaccinations are an unnecessary risk. People in less affluent countries are desperate for these life saving medicines[*](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery "Around 1.5 million children die each year due to vaccine preventable diseases particularly diarrhea and phenomena tens of thousands more suffer severe or permanently disabling illness. Figures from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation"), and if we stop vaccinating we will see these diseases return, and then we will be desperate too.

###Why are vegans susceptible to anti-vax rhetoric?

Vegans are used to questioning cultural paradigms. We became vegans because we didn’t believe our friends, families, governments and supermarkets claims that it is okay to exploit animals for our own pleasure. It doesn't take particularly acute research skills to uncover the fact that burgers are made of cows, I made that discovery at the age of ten and forswore all meat from then onwards[*](none "It took many more years for me to realise that animals are exploited in the dairy and egg industries and become vegan"). We are used to being told we are wrong or overreacting and we have learnt to follow our own intuition and do our own research instead of trusting authority. It doesn't seem surprising that many vegans would be suspicious of vaccines: firstly vaccines are not vegan, secondly the people who insist vaccines are essential are scientists. Vegans are more likely than other people to be convinced by the portrayal of scientists as evil madmen bereft of hubris[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist  "The ‘Mad Scientist’ trope is so well established it has a Wikipedia entry") because biomedical advances often come at the cost of horrific animal experimentation[*](https://cflegacy.research.umn.edu/iacuc/public_media/medadvances.cfm "Many biomedical researchers seem to justify the continued use of animals based on their past achievements instead of investigating the use of non-animal models. Here is a sample of medical advances and breakthroughs achieved through the use of animals in research, including several vaccines") and nutrition science has historically misinformed us that eating animals is necessary for health. Like the rest of the general public vegans are under-informed about science. Though things seem to be improving recently science communication has a history of being inaccessible, boring and confusing[*](http://ascb.org/anti-vaxers-and-the-failure-of-science-communication/ "This article for ASCB discusses the failure of science communication using the confusion about vaccines as an example"). Add to this unhappy mixture the fact that scientists such as the one in the post that inspired this article can be condescending and dismissive of our lifestyle. When we start researching vaccines we do not turn to boring science texts produced by nefarious anti-vegan scientists we naturally turn to sources we trust. 

Unfortunately the vegan community has misplaced its trust. Pseudoscience is rife in the vegan sphere precisely because we have decided to value the wrong sources of information. And people are exploiting this market. Vegans are being sold at best ineffective and at worst dangerous information and products by [charlatans](http://rvgn.org/2014/08/09/are-veggie-festivals-worth-putting-up-with-pseudoscientific-trinkets-and-petty-fraud/). I was handed anti-vax leaflet at a vegan event because the person selling tickets to their lecture on the dangers of vaccines had a fair expectation that I would be more interested in hearing what one homeopath[*](http://www.jayne-donegan.co.uk/ "The homeopath in question is Dr Jayne Donegan who proudly asserts her support of the discredited and fraudulent work of Andrew Wakefeild on her website where she offers dangerous anti-science advice to parents") had to say about vaccines than referring to the vast body of scientific literature on the subject. This was a sad but reasonable assumption.

It is in the interests of people selling pseudoscience to vegans to maintain our distrust of science. It is in our personal interest and that of the vegan movement to not allow an understandable dislike of some scientists undermine a trust in the scientific method.

###Why anti-vax sentiment is bad for veganism

It should be clear by now why not vaccinating children is bad for individual children and the world as a whole. If enough people vaccinated we create ‘herd immunity[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity "Herd immunity contains the spread of contagious disease within a comminity for more information consult wikipedia")’ which means that people who cannot be vaccinated because they are too young, too sick or otherwise immunocompromised are also safe from the disease. If a high enough percentage of the population is vaccinated we can entirely eradicate a disease as we have done with smallpox. We cannot advocate for animals if we are dying from preventable diseases and we should care about the human animals other than ourselves that we put at risk by abstaining from vaccination. 

The reason the drunken scientist’s response really annoyed me was because it conveyed an uncomfortable truth about how vegans are perceived. People think vegans are irrational anti-scientific, and overly sentimental (which I sometimes suspect is code for ‘stupid’). It is convenient to hold these beliefs about vegans, it allows people to dismiss our ideas without giving them full consideration. We all know that a good idea *can* come from an unlikely source but our brains have evolved to be susceptible to judging the idea by the merits or demerits of it’s proponents[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem "Which is why we find ad hominem arguments (arguements that attack a persons character rather than their ideas) so convincing"), if the person telling us we are wrong seems mean, unreasonable  or just a bit kooky we are much more likely to dismiss their arguments. If we want our arguments for veganism to be taken seriously we have to present ourselves as serious people, espousing ridiculous and dangerous conspiracy theories about vaccines does not make us look good. Nick Cooney[*](http://www.amazon.com/Veganomics-Surprising-Motivates-Vegetarians-Breakfast/dp/1590564286/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430392435&sr=8-1&keywords=veganomics "Nick is the founder of the Humane League and author of several well researched books on the psychology of changing minds, particularly relevant is his 2013 book 'Veganomics: The Surprising Science on what motivates Vegetarians, from the Breakfast Table to the Bedroom' available to purchase at Amazon") has reviewed the literature on the most effective way to change people's behaviour, he has amongst many other pertinent insights, concluded that people respond best to advocates who they perceive to be ‘like them’ an idea that seems to come from within our own peer group is much more palatable and worthy of consideration than one coming from someone who seems to be unlike us. The association of veganism with pseudo-science and fringe beliefs hinders our advocacy. People see themselves as ‘reasonable’ and are much more likely to respond positively to an argument from a reasonable vegan.

I think veganism is a rational position and I think using the tools of reason and science can only make our arguments stronger. Cultivating a knowledge and respect for science in the vegan community allows us to back up our empathetic impulses with reference to facts[*](http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf "For example I’ve had a lot less prolonged arguements about the sentience of animals since the 2012 Cambridge Declaration of Conciousness was published") and consistent logical arguments. Critical thinking skills are vital to any philosophical movement they help us present our arguments and ensure a commitment to self examination rather than dogma[*](http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/ar-skepticism-animal-rights.html "I’ve written elsewhere on the importance of skepticism in the animal rights movement ‘Can Skepticism Save the Animal Rights Movement? I’m Optimistic’"). By pushing back against the anti-vax propaganda in our community we are advocating for reason and evidence. This keeps us healthy and safe, promotes critical thinking and makes us better advocates for animals. 

If our primary goal as vegans is to reduce animal suffering then pushing back against anti-vax fear-mongering is vital, not only because of the thousands of human lives that are saved by vaccines but because a commitment to rationality in the vegan movement makes us stronger. And a strong, rational, animal advocacy movement is the most effective way to reduce animal suffering.
