Recently, Facebook users had their feeds filled with a deluge of people dunking themselves in ice water to raise money, mostly, for the ALS association[*](http://www.alsa.org/ "A charity that gathers funds to further research into Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and support those suffering from the disease"), a charity dedicated to the investigation for a cure for motor neurone disease. This has caused shock and outrage among some, mostly due to having their phone batteries<!--more--> depleted thanks to the instant-play function of Facebook. Other complaints come from people wanting to see altruism displayed in a less showy way, asking why donations can't be made without the video of a person being covered in ice water. Some complain about the allocations of funds made by the ALS association[*](http://ruthless-politics.com/fraction-als-donations-actually-go-research/ "Some sources are reporting figures such as only 28% of donations being spent on research by a charity primarily dedicated to research"). 

Pamela Anderson - actress, model and member of PETA - has complained that the ALS association uses animals in their medical research, and refused to involve herself in the challenge. Instead she created a video calling for the ALS to stop its animal testing[*](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pamela-anderson-rejects-ice-bucket-challenge-because-of-als-experiments-on-animals-mice-had-holes-drilled-into-their-skulls-9685445.html "An article for the Independant documenting Anderson’s stance").

My shock stems from the number of pictures I have seen posted in response to the challenge that look like this:

These memes are being passed around Facebook by omnivores delighting in the pleasure of their Sunday roast and simultaneously being outraged by the use of animals for medical research.  This sort of schizophrenic moralisation is very confusing, why is the animal being eaten less worthy than the animal being tested on? Who decides the worth of these sentient beings and when is the decision made? As Gary Francione stated, there is an ‘enormous amount of confusion about the moral status of nonhumans, (it) is a phenomenon that is quite complicated and has many different aspects’[*](http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/a-note-on-moral-schizophrenia/#.VBKt6_ldWa9 "Francione introduces the concept of moral schizophrenia in his landmark animal rights text 'Introduction to Animal Rights: Your Child or the Dog?' and elaborates in a blog post"). Francione uses the term ‘moral schizophrenia’ to describe the confusion and delusion that exist when we hold multiple contradictory ideas regarding animals which result in arbitrary decisions made regarding their lives and deaths. The majority of people would probably agree that animal testing is a more laudable end for the use of lives than purely for the pleasure of eating them. Though one might be considered a lesser moral evil I firmly believe that all animal exploitation is unacceptable and think we should move away from it in our medical research.  

As I've heard Penn Jillette say, ‘there are no ends there are only means’[*](https://twitter.com/pennjillette/status/10848810384 "It is such a common refrain it could be considered one of Jillette’s catchprases, although I’m sure the sentiment has been expressed by many. One example in a tweet from Jillette"). My interpretation of this aphorism is that the world is a work in progress, in which every action we take has innumerable consequences; there is no day of judgement when our final grades are handed to us. There may be personal endings in death, but we are not there to witness them. Epicurus famously told us that ‘where death is, I am not; and where I am, death is not’[*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus "A brief introducion to Epicurus’ philosophy can be found on his Wikipedia page"). Our lives are a series of actions achieving no ultimate goal. Looking at life and the world from this perspective refocuses our attention on how we live and the means we use to advance our interests; it exposes the hubris of committing an immoral act to achieve an illusory goal. Unlike the consequentialists, I believe we cannot justify a course of action dependent on a specific outcome, for example animal testing is justified because we are protecting the interests of our own species by advancing medical science, but the cost of this ‘means’ seems too morally high for us to bear. 

Vivisection, the practice of animal testing, has been used substantially throughout our medical history and we have unarguably gained a huge amount of knowledge from it and saved many human lives. This does not imply that the practice is perfect or that it should continue as we are developing better models to gain the information we need[*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19453215 "An article from Pub Med detailing the emerging use of computer models as an alternative for animal models in reserch"). Many drugs have been withdrawn from the market after extensive animal testing as they have produced reactions in humans that weren't predicted by animal testing; for example Vioxx, an animal tested arthritis drug, reportedly caused 140,000 heart attacks in its users before being withdrawn[*](http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/campaigns/experiments/all/730/ "Of course anecdotes like these do not prove that animal testing is useless, but they do undermine claims that it is infalliable and suggest research into developing better models would be advisable even if there were no ethical concerns with vivisection").

We have used human clinical research to  great effect in the past, namely with the polio vaccine to produce medicines that are safe and effective in humans while the animal studies argued against the effectiveness of these medicines, confusing research and delaying help to those who needed it.  Modern medicine has developed some, thankfully, much less painful and more effective methods of gaining results without harming animals, computer modelling leads the way with this and current technologies produce amazing results[*](http://angryhippie.info/ask-science-dude-animal-testing "A through and intellectually honest overview of animal testing from a vegan perspective is presented in podcast form")[*](http://www.aavs.org/site/c.bkLTKfOSLhK6E/b.6457015/k.CAC4/Animal_Research_Alternatives.htm#.VBhzGvldWa8 "More information on alternatives to animal testing are presented here").

Many people consider themselves ‘animal lovers’ and will happily tell you this while eating a chicken sandwich. The cultural idea that one animal is more important than another or that the suffering of one animal is less important than another is ingrained in our society. We happily slaughter millions of chickens every year in this country alone yet balk at the idea of our pets suffering even a momentary discomfort. Where do these apparent contradictions come from?  We are socialised to accept a hierarchy of animal importance with those who humans associate with, think are cute or look like us at the top. This hierarchy is implicit in our culture and we accept it without question allowing it to guide our decisions about how we treat, or mistreat, non-human animals. Dogs are a great example of this idea; the majority of westerners are horrified by the idea of eating dog, as they are ‘man’s best friend’.  However for people from countries who are not socialised to think of dogs as friends but food; eating dogs is as natural as it is in our culture to eat cows or pigs. 

We have another, seemingly contradictory, cultural bias. We appreciate the company of certain animals and think of ourselves as good and kind when we treat animals with care but we also participate in and commission the exploitation of animals. Allowing the exploitation of some animals to co-exist with the love of others forces us to experience a psychological discomfort called cognitive dissonance[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance "Wikipedia article explaining cognitive dissonance"). To resolve the discomfort of dissonance an individual can either ignore the knowledge of the exploitation of animals, convince themselves that all animals are not worthy of their care or stop participating in causing animal suffering. These seem to be all-or-nothing solutions and so our lazy human brains usually take another option that does not resolve the dissonance but represses or ignores it: we make stuff up. The hierarchy of animals and the different categories ‘farm animals’ ‘pets’ ‘working animals’ could be interpreted as post-hoc rationalisations for why it's ok to treat animals the way we do.

The reaction to the ALS association's testing on animals has highlighted, for me, the amount of dissonance that my Facebook acquaintances are experiencing. Knowing that the food you are eating and some of your clothes are made from animal products, yet complaining of animal research in medicine is an indicator of some significant moral confusion.  

Perhaps it is because the horrifying pictures are of monkeys to whom we feel so closely linked. Our culture perceives animals primarily by their appearance rather than their sentience and ability to feel. This may be a strategy for avoiding the discomfort of cognitive dissonance that Francione dubs ‘moral schizophrenia’ and it creates a society where it is acceptable to treat one animal completely differently to another. I have even heard it argued that teaching children this habit of judging intelligence and awareness by appearance rather than assessing it rationally could be where racism springs from. According to Hugh Lafollette (in his comprehensive paper on *The Origins of Speciesism*) there is a ‘historical connection between speciesism and racism. Historically the two are inextricably intertwined, the former being used to bolster, explain, and justify the latter’[*](http://www.hughlafollette.com/papers/SPECIES.HTM "The Origins of Speciesism is available here and is highly reccomended for those interested in the concept of speciesm and its consequences"). Animals are being exploited on a daily basis all around us but our society and our cultural norms teach us to believe it is either inconsequential or necessary.  I would argue it is neither, we have alternatives within our reach for food and alternatives to vivisection are maturing there is no realistic moral argument that the suffering of any being is inconsequential.
