If you're alive and read things, you've probably heard of cryptocurrency, or at least bitcoin. Opinions vary on the efficacy, future and utility  of cryptocurrency[1], but few can deny it has the potential to change the financial world. Several prominent venture capitalists[2] and institutions [3] are calling cryptocurrency the 'next internet'. The concept is young; the original bitcoin whitepaper was only published in 2009. There have been controversies[silk road][mtgox], and the whole thing might not work on a global scale. Maybe the bubble will burst, leaving only gigabytes of worthless data. Or maybe it will help change everything[etherium].

Cryptocurrencies are complex (though far less complex than the banking system) and I won't attempt to explain how they work in much detail here. Briefly, a cryptocurrency is a secure, digital form of money that isn't issued or controlled by a central authority[4]. Funds are in the direct control of their owners, and can't be confiscated or transferred without consent. Money is stored in digital *wallets* (which are vaguely analogous to bank accounts) and ownership of wallets is completely anonymous. Funds can be sent almost instantly to anyone in the world for a nominal fee. There is no registration and no personal details need to provided at any time. You can think of cryptocurrency as digital cash. It's fungible, nearly untraceable, and you can loose it if you're not careful. 

[there are many cryptocurrencies]

[and now there's a vegan one.]

X. Hello X! What is voin, and how did you become involved in cryptocurrency?

X. Some exponents of cryptocurrency don't see it as a replacement to fiat currency, so much as a natural compliment. Several cryptocurrencies were designed with specific tasks in mind (For example, Auroracoin is specifically intended for use in Iceland; Ethereum was designed to power smart contracts; mining CureCoin contributes to medical research in the form of protein folding, etc). What are the goals or intended uses of voin, and where do you see it fitting in?

X. Historically, currencies have been freely exchanged between social groups as much as possible. Voin is different. It insulates wealth within a very specific social sphere (that of veganism and vegan causes) and creates a sort of ethically-driven micro-economy. If voin were very successful, how do you think it would affect the cause of veganism and its public perception? More importantly, how effective do you think it would be in furthering vegan aims?

X. I have an early release of the client software, which is compiled for Windows only. Do you plan on releasing voin-branded client and node applications for other platforms, and will the project be open source?

X. I've restricted myself to one technical question for the sake of the reader. Voin is derived from bitcoin, and presumably shares the same SHA-256 hash algorithm implementation. Given the hardware arms race in the bitoin world and the enormously high mining difficulty of that network, there are hardcore professional miners out there with incredible hardware that's no longer efficacious for mining bitcoin. Are you concerned that some non-vegan cryto-golddiggers might quickly dominate the network? Do you have a strategy for getting voins into the hands of people who want them, and no one else? 

X. Finally, the voin elevator pitch. You're going down in an elevator with someone who you know is vegan. They seem nice. You got on at the 30th floor, and when the doors open at the bottom you probably won't see them again. They've told you that they have a cursory grasp of cryptocurrency, and they're generally interested in the idea. There are twenty-nine floors left now, time is ticking. How do you tell them what voin is and why they should care before you reach the lobby?

Rather, they're a public ledger of transactions secured by 'mining' on the network. The ledger entries are extremely difficult to counterfeit, hack or otherwise interfere with â€“ which makes them ideal for financial purposes. In a way, the 'currency' part of cryptocurrency is an emergent property of the system, not an intrinsic component. The same technology can be, and is, used for all sorts of other things. 'Cryptocurrencies Explained' provides a good, step-by-step breakdown of how bitcoin works, and it's generally the same for all cryptocurrencies")
