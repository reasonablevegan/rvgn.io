#Contribute

If you are interested in supporting Reasonable Vegan’s goals of nurturing critical thinking in vegan spaces and promoting veganism as a rational ethical choice, we'd like to hear from you! Please contribute to the discussion by commenting on our articles and engaging with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/rvgn_org" class="external-link" target="_blank">social media</a>.

Part of being reasonable is accepting constructive criticism as well as fawning praise. If you have any of either about the project, the website or anything else, please contact [feedback@rvgn.org](mailto:feedback@rvgn.org).

If you are interested in writing an article for us, please read the [about us](/about) section of this website. If you are *still* interested, here are our contributor's guidelines:

- We are looking for articles that discuss topics relevant to veganism from an evidence-based perspective. We publish on a wide variety of topics including science, ethics, philosophy, current events, pseudoscience and opinion pieces. We hope to present informed but informal content. Opinion, untested ideas and speculation are welcome as long as they are grounded in a rational understanding of the world and not presented as fact. We also do not flinch from potentially controversial topics. Our hope is that through respectful discussion and critical thinking we can make our ideas stronger.

- We expect our writers to be, well, reasonable vegans. Our understanding of the word *reasonable* means both fair minded, open and respectful and an adherent of reason and logical inquiry. Our understanding of the word *vegan* matches the Vegan Society's definition: 'Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.' That said, we are very interested to publish articles addressing the limits of 'possibility and practicality’ and the boundaries of the animal kingdom.

- An average article on Reasonable Vegan could be anywhere from 500 to 2,000 words, will include citations for any quotes, and plenty of links backing up the author's argument. We invite an informal tone but hope not to stray into snarkiness or deliberate, unnecessary provocation. We hope that our readers will discuss the articles we publish and that the ideas presented will be explored by other writers for Reasonable Vegan, therefore we expect our writers to be humble and open to adjusting their ideas in the face of evidence-based criticism.

- We are developing an informal peer-review system to asses potential articles and assist with editing them. If you submit an article to reasonable vegan it will be reviewed by at least two other reasonable vegans. If the article is appropriate for the site, we will provide the author with any necessary comments and/or suggestions on how to improve the content. Once the article has been sanity checked and edited for grammar crimes, we will put it in the queue for publishing. This process is intended to ensure that our articles are of high quality and are based on reason and evidence. It's not a foolproof system and we expect to publish the occasional inaccuracy.  

To contribute an article to reasonable vegan please [contact us](mailto:contribute@rvgn.org). If you have already written an article please include a brief description of the content and attach the text in a word file or a provide a link to read it on your personal blog. If you just have an idea for an article send us an overview and we will let you know if we are interested.

All this sounds very formal and restrictive, but it isn't really. Our ultimate goal is to help the best possible people (that's you) to have the biggest possible reach in your field – at least as long as that field promotes veganism. Our 'product' is developed by talented professionals who work for free to get the Reasonable Vegan message out there, and we'd be honoured to have you on board. It just wouldn't be the same without you.
